I love to cook! Currently, everything I make is vegetarian/vegan. I'm ideally building out a suite of recipes for myself that are tasty and ideally help me maintain a long & healthy life. Lots of vegetables, whole grains, etc. 

## You Too Can Make Pickled Onions!

Recipe from [Every way of making pink pickled onions, the greatest condiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VPkezPD0EE)

* Slice a red onion into thin wedges  
* Cover them about 2/3rds of the way up with room temperature vinegar plus a little lime juice (and maybe some water if you like them less tart), a pinch of salt, a handful of sugar, and maybe a few spices.   
* Throw them in the fridge and stir once or twice over the next few hours. They'll be pickles in about a day.   
* Keep in the fridge for a week or two.

## My Cooking Philosophy

**I focus on making...**

- Vegan/Vegetarian dishes  
- (ideally) healthy meals - lots of veggies, whole grains, etc.   
- I usually cook for just myself, often I'll make a big dish and eat leftovers over the next few days   
- I'm working on building out good recipes to have for hosting 3-4 people
