# You Too Can Make Pickled Onions\!

Recipe from [Every way of making pink pickled onions, the greatest condiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VPkezPD0EE)

* Slice a red onion into thin wedges  
* Cover them about 2/3rds of the way up with room temperature vinegar plus a little lime juice (and maybe some water if you like them less tart), a pinch of salt, a handful of sugar, and maybe a few spices.   
* Throw them in the fridge and stir once or twice over the next few hours. They'll be pickles in about a day.   
* Keep in the fridge for a week or two.

# Home Cooking 

I love to cook\! Currently, everything I make is vegetarian/vegan. I’m ideally building out a suite of recipes for myself that are tasty and ideally help me maintain a long & healthy life. Lots of vegetables, whole grains, etc. 

**I focus on making...**

- Vegan/Vegetarian dishes  
- (ideally) healthy meals \- lots of veggies, whole grains, etc.   
- I usually cook for just myself, often I’ll make a big dish and eat leftovers over the next few days   
- I’m working on building out good recipes to have for hosting 3-4 people

**We might like similar food if you also enjoy:**

* Strong, depth of flavor (like an Indian curry)   
* Crunchy/crispy (Granola, thoroughly cooked waffles)   
* Acidity (Pickled onions\!)

  * Super rich flavor, used in tacos, [burrito bowls](https://rainbowplantlife.com/vegan-burrito-bowl/), nachos, enchiladas, etc.   
  * I’ll make a batch and then eat it in various forms over the next week  
* [Spicy Chili Garlic Noodles](https://rainbowplantlife.com/vegan-chili-garlic-noodles/)
